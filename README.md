# Ts2landingBuilder

## This is a tool to build a Landing page using [ts2landing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts2landing) package.
Use it to create the Landing structure and later can change the styles with CSS applying to the elements IDs.

For now it's possible to build the Introduction object. 
> Content builder coming soon.
